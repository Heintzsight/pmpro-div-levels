The default PMPro Membership Levels page displays in a table layout. This plugin changes your levels page layout to use a DIV for each level. If you are using the PMPro Level Cost Text add on, it will use that text for the generated price sentence. Alternately, it will just use the automatically generated level cost text PMPro provides.

== Description ==
This plugin requires Paid Memberships Pro to function.

Display your Membership Levels in a DIV layout, allowing you to add custom CSS to create a more interesting Membership Levels page appearance.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `pmpro-div-levels` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of your site.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. That's it. No settings.
